#### Full Description:
Tino is a digital wellbeing experiment by give you a deep overview how many notifications your phone arrives.

The main idea is that you can see how long a notification stays in average in the NotificationBar. But you get also deep insights in other statistics like
* How many notification you received in overall
* Which App sends you the most notification and how many
* How long stayed the longest notification in the NotificationBar
* The sum of how long all of the notifications stayed in the NotificationBar since App installation

You could also checkout the same statistics of your friends. Simple search for your friends name and see their notification statistics.

The App should help you to get an overview about how many notifications you receive on your device. These information could then be used to reflect your Smartphone usage and if it would make sense to disable a few App notifications so you don't get distracted from your real life anymore!
